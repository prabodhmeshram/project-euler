## Solution to **Project Euler** problems

This repository is to list down as many Euler problem solutions as possible by me in different Programming languages. Amateur or to put it best a complete newbie in major of the languages, but learning along the path all of them. A great way to hone your skills if creating a Todo App and Hello World is real boring for you. Good for a math geek or learning in the process while attempting the Euler Problems.

A very good description has been given on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about), so you can always check on that.
